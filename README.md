### Project Description

**Pixelfy** is a lightweight, web-based image filter tool that allows users to apply various color effects to their images in real-time. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and the `SimpleImage` library, Pixelfy provides an easy, interactive way to experiment with basic image processing directly in the browser.

With Pixelfy, you can upload an image and choose from multiple color filters, including grayscale, red, green, and blue tints. Each filter creates a unique visual effect:
- **Grayscale**: Averages color values for a classic black-and-white effect.
- **Red Tint**: Enhances red tones, with conditional brightness adjustment.
- **Green Tint**: Adds a green hue, especially in darker image areas.
- **Blue Tint**: Boosts blue tones for a cool, tinted look.

Pixelfy is perfect for beginners and anyone interested in learning basic web development and image manipulation techniques. The tool uses a canvas to display each modified image, allowing for an interactive, hands-on editing experience. A simple “Reset” option lets users revert to the original image after experimenting with different filters.

The project is designed for easy use and extension, making it a valuable educational tool or a base for building more advanced image editing features. 

### Key Features
- **Real-time Image Filtering**: Instantly see changes applied to your image.
- **Intuitive UI**: Straightforward controls for uploading and filtering.
- **Extendable Design**: Easily add more filters and effects to the code.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Upload an image and select a filter button to apply the effect.

Whether you’re just starting with HTML and JavaScript or looking to add interactive effects to a project, Pixelfy provides a fun and approachable experience in web-based image manipulation.
